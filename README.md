## Foreword
I recently stumbled upon a fascinating video on YouTube by the channel 3Blue1Brown. The video explores the concept of Newton's method, a mathematical technique used to find roots of a function. What's particularly interesting about the video is that it's accompanied by a Pygame demonstration, which shows how Newton's method can be used to visualize the roots of a polynomial function.

The Pygame demonstration is very user-friendly and easy to follow, even for someone like me who isn't an expert in mathematics. The demonstration allows you to select a polynomial function with coefficients of your choice and then visualize its roots as points on a graph. You can then use Newton's method to find the roots of the function by clicking on a particular point on the graph.
